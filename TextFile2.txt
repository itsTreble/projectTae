You have beautiful hair.
I like your style.
You make the best cereal.
I heard the kid next door wants to be just like you.
Your circuits look shiny today.
Your code is superior.
I wish I could be like you one day.
You're a classy robot.
You're cooler than the other side of the pillow.
Are you a beaver, because damn.
I bet you make babies smile.
You make me lose ctrl.
How's your day?
I doin't like robots.
Let's play!
If I could rearrange the alphabet, I would put "U" and "I" together. And it would stand for "user interface."
Damn. Your specs.
Are you a camera? Because every time I look at you, I smile.
Wanna see a magic trick?
